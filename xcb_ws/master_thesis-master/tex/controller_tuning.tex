\section{Controller Tuning} % (fold)
\label{sec:controller_tuning}
The software modules node\_navigation, node\_aruco and node\_controller described in section~\ref{sec:implementation} are implemented and running in real time locally on the \gls{UAV}. Tests are conducted by manual takeoff and flight to a starting point at a distance from the landing pad. The \textit{do land} command is then triggered from the work station and the UAV, running the controller defined in chapter~\ref{cha:controller} performs autonomous landing. The parameters listed in \ref{tab:stateMachineParameters} are used in the implemented state machine.

Figure~\ref{fig:controller_tuning} presents a plot of the relative position estimate between the \gls{UAV} and landing pad $\vect{p}^{n}_{l/u}$ calculated by the state estimator during the test. The states from the state machine are included in the figure as vertical lines marked with the state name.

Moreover, the \textit{Adjust} and \textit{Final} are abbreviations for \textit{Gain Adjust} and \textit{Final Stage}.

As indicated in figure~\ref{sec:controller_tuning}, the first 19 seconds of the flight is carried out manually. The state machine then enters the \textit{intercept} state and the UAV starts to fly towards the hovering point. From the \textit{intercept} phase in figure~\ref{fig:controller_tuning}, there is a "jump" in the position estimate. This is due to filter corrections in the appearance of AruCo measurements. The state machine goes straight from \textit{Intercept} state to \textit{Lower}, not including the \textit{Hover} state. This is a result of the high value set as parameter for the minimum covariance in hover $c_h$. The oscillations in the north and east position caused by the wind affecting the \gls{UAV}. During the Gain Adjust phase, the north and east position stabilizes, making the UAV stable trough the \textit{Final} state until it finally triggers the \textit{Land} command.


\subsection{Summary} % (fold)
\label{sub:controller_summary}
Several dozens of physical real-time test on a static landing pad have been conducted using the implemented software modules node\_navigation, node\_aruco and node\_controller. The autonomous system has given exceptional results, by performing precise and stable landings with high repeatability.
