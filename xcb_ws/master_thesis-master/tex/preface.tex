This thesis concludes my masters degree in Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

The quadcopter, ground vehicle and surface vehicle used in this thesis, all equipped with necessary sensors, controllers and communication systems are provided by \gls{FFI}. \gls{FFI} have also facilitated with office space and paid for travel expenses. The background and contributions of the project are described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:background_and_contributions} \nameref{sec:background_and_contributions}

First of all, I would like to thank my co-supervisor Aleksander Simonsen from \gls{FFI}, for help and guidance, and never the less for his interest and engagement in my work. Also, thanks to all the other researchers at \gls{FFI} that have been very accommodating and have gladly attended discussions. Furthermore, thanks to my supervisor Kristin Y. Pettersen for signing up as supervisor and answering my technical questions. Lastly, thanks to Erik Wilthil and Andreas Lindahl Fl√•ten for great discussions and for sharing some of their prime knowledge on state estimators.
