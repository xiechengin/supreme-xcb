% pickValley - A function takes in an array of valleys Nx2 and 
% finds which one is closest to the desired T_heading.
%   
% INPUTS:
% valleyArs - a Nx2 array of all candidate valleys.  These are
%             passed as a range.  The first column is the starting index 
%             of the valley, and the second valumn is the ending index. 
%             (can range from 0 to 90)
%
% T_heading - The heading of the target in the range of 1-90.
%
% OUTPUTS:
% chosenValley - The range of the chosen valley which the robot will take
%                given as a 1x2 range.

%Finds the distance to each rising or falling edge
dist = abs(valleyArs-T_heading);
