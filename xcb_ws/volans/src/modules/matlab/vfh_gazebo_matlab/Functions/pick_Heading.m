% pick_Heading - 3/28/16
% This function examines the chosen valley that is passed in and determines
% if it is wide or narrow. Depending on its width, the robot will pick a
% heading that gives it the best path to the target while safely navigating
% the obstacle field.
%
% INPUTS:
% Th = The sector location [1 to 90] of the target in relation to the
%      robots current heading.
% chosenValley = The range of the chosen valley which the robot will take
%                given as a 1x2 range.
% wideValleyMin = Minimum number of sectors to classify a valley as 'WIDE'
% sectToClear = Number of sectors that need to be free for the robot to 
%               pass through without hitting.
%
% OUTPUT:
% heading = Return the sector heading of the robot

    %in line with the target while still avoiding obstacles.
